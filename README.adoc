= WIPER

Wiper is a tool which can be used to delete unwanted files and folders from a directory tree. Files and directories to be wiped can be configured via names or regex patterns. You can also exclude specific files or folders (for example to exclude the `Library` folder on macOS).

Wiper can optionally move deleted items to the user's Trash (`use_trash: true`) instead of permanently removing them.
